# Dopyter

Opinionated mix of Docker + Python + [Jupyter][jupyter] for Data Analysis. This
project is inspired by the awesome [Jupyter Docker Stacks][docker-stacks].

## Quick Start

Dopyter is only a Docker container with Jupyter, and a variety
of Python 3 [packages][packages] such as Numpy, Pandas, or Scikit Learn, in a
ready-to-use form. To use Dopyter, you'll need to install Docker on your
machine.

To launch an instance of Dopyter in the your current folder, run:

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 -it --rm davidgasquez/dopyter
```

You can also pass an `.env` file like this:

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 -it --env-file=.env --rm davidgasquez/dopyter
```

This will spawn a Jupyter Notebook in [`localhost:8888`][lh].You can now start
analyzing, plotting and predicting your fancy data.
